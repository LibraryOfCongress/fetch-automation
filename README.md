## Automation

This is **FETCH **automation project. This repository demonstrates how to set up and use Cucumber with Selenium WebDriver for automated testing of web application using Java and Maven, integrated with IntelliJ IDEA.


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed and set up:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA installed (or any other Java IDE)
- Git installed and configured
- Maven installed


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project and run the tests:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://git.example.com/fetch/automation.git
   ```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Select `File` -> `Open` and navigate to the cloned directory.

3. Resolve Dependencies:

   - IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect and download the necessary dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file. If not, you can manually trigger a Maven build to download them.

4. Usage:

   - Cucumber feature files are located in `src/test/resources/uiFeatures`.
   - Step definitions using Selenium WebDriver are located in `src/test/java/automation/step_definitions`.
   - Use Maven to build and manage dependencies.


## Test Execution

1. Run Individual Feature Files:

   - Cucumber feature files are located in `src/test/resources/uiFeatures`.
   - To run a specific feature file, locate it under `src/test/resources/uiFeatures`, right-click on it, and select `Run`'Feature: <name>'.

2. Running Test via TestRunner:

   - Open TestRunner class located in src/test/java/runner.
   - The `@CucumberOptions` `tags` annotation in this class can be modified to control which tests are run. `Tags` could be found in Feature Files in `src/test/resources/uiFeatures`.(E.g. tags = "@accession")
   - Right-click on the file and choose `Run``TestRunner`.

3. Viewing Test Results:

   - After running the tests, view the test results in the IntelliJ IDEA `Run` tool window.
   - The results will show the status (pass/fail) of each scenario and step defined in your feature files and corresponding step definitions.
